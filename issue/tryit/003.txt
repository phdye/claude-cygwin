🚀 Creating launcher script...
✅ Created executable launcher: claude-shell-cygwin
🧪 Testing launcher...
🚀 Executing: echo Quick setup test successful!
❌ Command failed
Error: Helper timeout after 40 seconds
🔢 Exit code: -1
⏱️ Execution time: 40.00s
✅ Launcher test passed
🧪 Testing command execution...
❌ Command failed: Helper timeout after 20 seconds
🎉 Quick Setup Complete!
=======================
✅ No pip hanging issues!
✅ Package ready to use
Usage:
  ./claude-shell-cygwin test        # Test connectivity
  ./claude-shell-cygwin exec "pwd"   # Execute command
Python usage:
  export PYTHONPATH=$(pwd)/src:$PYTHONPATH
  python -c "from claude_shell_connector import run_command; print(run_command('echo test').stdout)"
Add to ~/.bashrc for permanent setup:
  export PYTHONPATH=/home/phdyex/my-repos/claude-cygwin/src:$PYTHONPATH
  export PYTHONIOENCODING=utf-8
  export CYGWIN=nodosfilewarning
🧪 Additional testing...
